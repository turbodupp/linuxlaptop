### 0. Proper power management and s3 sleep

IMPORTANT: To enable s3 sleep you need to flash your BIOS to a newer version. Unsure the specific version at this point, but as of 15. SEP. 2019 the newest BIOS was able to do s3 sleep no problem.

Only thing you have to change is <b> sleep settings in bios, change from windows to other/linux </b>

- it should be noted that you CAN get better battery life by installing some optional tools, altho POP is decent at this baseline
`sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw acpi-call-dkms tp-smapi-dkms acpi-call-dkms`

### 1. Communication suite. Getting outlook, teams and rocketchat up and running.

- **USE FRANZ**
To get rocketchat working just a self-hosted variant, the rest is self-explanatory.
Same goes with outlook o365/teams, just add and log in.

### 3. Shell env

Currently running ZSH with powerlevel10k theme, to install it do:

`sudo apt install zsh`
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
`git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k`

then edit ~/.zshrc and change ZSH_THEME to powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k

next time you restart shell it should start the powerlevel10k install

However you do need propper fonts for it to display properly. Currently im using meslo LGS, which you can get here:
- [MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf](https://github.com/romkatv/dotfiles-public/raw/master/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf)
- [MesloLGS NF Bold.ttf](https://github.com/romkatv/dotfiles-public/raw/master/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf)
