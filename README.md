### 0. Proper power management and s3 sleep

IMPORTANT: To enable s3 sleep you need to flash your BIOS to a newer version. Unsure the specific version at this point, but as of 15. SEP. 2019 the newest BIOS was able to do s3 sleep no problem.

Only thing you have to change is <b> sleep settings in bios, change from windows to other/linux </b>

### 1. Communication suite. Getting outlook, teams and rocketchat up and running.

To get rocketchat working just a self-hosted variant, the rest is self-explanatory.
Same goes with outlook o365/teams, just add and log in.
